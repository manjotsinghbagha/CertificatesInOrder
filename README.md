# CertificatesInOrder

A platform to verify learning credentials from any website, video, or book and get certified by giving a simple test online. And Create your Resume/Portfolio page with ease.
Get Easily Recognizable Non-Transferable NFT To show your Portfolio.

It is a Django Web Application that allows a Creator/author to create an online test and allow them to provide their followers with a unique certificate.
The application that I submitted is just a back-end, some reference Certificate designs and Front-end design files which need to be in integrated










I hoped to provide users with Non-Transferable NFT which they can show in there Crypto Wallet But i was not able to create due to lack of knowledge and lack of Python support with WEB3.

I was also not able to integrate all different prates of my project due to lack of time.


I would add all features related to NFT and provide Creator/author a ability to add there  own Certificate design.

In Future users would get ability to request for creation on there certificate as NFT and show them publicly.
